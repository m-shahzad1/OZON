# Ozon

Ozon is a futuristic style game set in the year 2729 in which the world has been destroyed by pollution and littering. All humans have moved to Mars as their last resort. The lack of space and resources have motivated humanity to create their savior, Ozon. Ozon is a bioengineered creature that will be sent to Earth via spaceship to defeat the garbage monsters and clean up Earth. 

##GamePlay

Ozon will face multiple kinds of garbage monsters, each more daunting than the last. Ozon will start out by simply eating the garbage in the introductory level. All levels will be played in classic 2D platformer style. In this stage of the game, the trash monsters are so small and weak, they can be squashed by simply jumping on them. As a reward for completing the first level, Ozon's first real ability will be revealed.

The remainder of the game is built around levels requiring the specific abilities gained through completing prior levels and bosses. The final stage will require all abilities granted to Ozon in the initial stages. At the end of all main stages, a themed garbage monster will be the boss of the stage, and the level will be ‘cleaned’ as the monster is defeated.

To traverse between the levels of the game, a 2D overworld will be used. This represents the earth and will change as levels are completed and cleaned. All of Ozon’s abilities will be related towards cleaning garbage and taking down the evil trash monsters. When the final level is completed along with the final boss at the end of the stage, the humans will come back and reward Ozon for his hard work.

## Rules

- Ozone was sent to earth on a spaceship and in the spaceship there were Ozu berries that helped in replenishing his health. 
- His spaceship malfunctioned and blew up while entering the atmosphere, causing all of the Ozu berries to scatter across the land. 
- There are two types of berries. One of the types replenishes your full health and is two shades of blue.  
- The other ones replenish a certain amount of health and are only one shade of blue. 
- The main player will have to restart the game if Ozon runs out of health. 
- Through the game each level will give a power up that will be useful in defeating enemies and picking up trash. 
- Each power up will be useful in picking up a certain type of trash. 
- At the end, all of these powers will be useful in defeating the final boss. 

##Character
Ozon will be a round character that has two eyes indicating the direction of fire and movement. Ozon will be able to be customized by its color, shoes and head accessories. As Ozon cleans the planet it will be visible that his efforts are making a difference as the environment will begin to look better.

##Enemies
- There will be multiple enemies with different levels of abilities. 
- Basic enemies will have basic movement. 
- More advanced enemies will have attack patterns and character tracking
##Map
- The map will consist of a home base of operations where Ozon has landed. From this “Home” Ozon will be able to travel from different paths into the different levels. 
- Ozon will also have levels which will improve his stats as the game progresses. 
- The overworld map is populated by non-playable characters (NPCs) with limited interactive capabilities, whom Ozone may engage with. These NPCs were originally dispatched to perform a cleanup of the planet, but their efforts proved largely ineffective, resulting in their aimless wanderings and the collection of scant
